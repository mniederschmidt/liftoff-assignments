<h3>Description of Meetup</h3>
<p>This meetup was attended by women working in tech.  The theme of the meetup was work life balance.  There were several good suggestions for achieving a good work life balance.  One of the ideas presented was to identify your ABC's.  Many of us would like to do everything at a 110% level, but that's not always possible.  Identify things that need to be done at that level, and things that are ok if done at a B or C level, like for example loading the dishwasher.  Other ideas were to outsource some tasks, to accept help when offered, to seek out and find companies that get the importance of work life balance, to remain positive, and celebrate ourselves and what we have done so far.  One of the ideas that I liked the most was to remain present and focused wherever we are.  When we are at work, we should focus on that of course, and when we are at home with our children, put aside the electronics and the need to check e-mail, and celebrate that time with our family.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>A list of questions and answers from the meetup. To really learn from a meektup you need to be <b>engaged</b>. So ask some questions, and list them here!</p>
* The speaker mentioned a strengths inventory she had taken and found really useful.  After her presentation, I asked her what that test was and she said it was the StrengthsFinder and she was really enthusiastic about how it helps people learn how to work better together by utilizing each person's unique strengths.
* I asked some of the front-end developers which frameworks they would recommend learning, and they said that it all depends and changes rapidly, but Node.js, React, and Angular were good ones to learn.
