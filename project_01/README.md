# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

I would like to create a Budget Tracker application, which would allow the user to set budget categories and amounts, and then track monthly spending against this goal.  There would be a mobile screen which would allow the user to enter purchases at stores as they are made.  Users could mark items for follow up and/or as tax-related/deductible.  Reports would show spending against goals (perhaps in a bar graph type display), as well as itemized purchases by payment type.

## Features

* User login, with the ability to add users to a family
* Create/read/update/delete budget categories and target amounts
* Mobile app to add expenses to apply to a budget category
* Ability to capture photos with mobile app to save receipts if needed
* Reports/dashboards to show spending which has occurred against monthly or year-to-date budget categories

## Technologies

* Java back-end to store budget information and expenses in database
* JavaScript front-end to establish budget categories and add expenses
* Mobile app written in Swift to add expenses and capture photos of receipts
* Database - possibly MySQL

## What I'll Have to Learn

* JavaScript
* Front-End Frameworks
* How to Deploy an Application
